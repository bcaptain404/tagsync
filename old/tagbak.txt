# TagSync

**TagSync** is an open-source, Linux-first toolkit for selective, tag-driven file backup and synchronization, built around extended attributes (xattrs).  
Unlike traditional backup or sync solutions, TagSync lets you decide exactly which files, directories, or special objects are included—simply by tagging them.  
No special folders, no messy inclusion/exclusion lists, and no accidental duplication. Just tag it, sync it.

## Project Structure

TagSync is built as a modular suite, where each utility does one thing well, and all tools share a consistent philosophy and naming scheme:

### Core Modules

- **TagBak**  
  One-way, selective backup utility.  
  Copies only tagged objects (and their directory hierarchies) to a destination, never follows symlinks, and never recurses into its own backup output.
  - *CLI tools*: `tbak`, `ts-bak`
  - Current stable module (v0.1.1)

- **TagRestore** *(planned)*  
  Restore utility, reconstructs files/directories from backups, guided by tags and preserved hierarchy.

- **TagSync** *(planned)*  
  Full-featured, one-way or two-way sync utility.  
  Lets you move or rename files anywhere on the filesystem—your tag follows the file, so duplicates and accidental overwrites are a thing of the past.

- **TagSearch** *(planned)*  
  Find tagged objects, search by ID, backup status, or tag content.

- **TagReport** *(planned)*  
  Generate detailed reports about backup status, last sync dates, missing/extra files, or ID collisions.

## Philosophy

- **Selective:** Only what you tag is backed up or synced.
- **Portable:** No reliance on proprietary folder structures or databases. All tracking info lives on the files themselves.
- **Transparent:** Command-line tools and planned GUI integrations let you see, manage, and verify tag status anytime.
- **Modular:** Use only the utilities you want; everything works standalone or together.
- **Safe:** Never backs up its own output, never follows symlinks, never surprises you.

## Example CLI Utility Names

- `tbak` or `ts-bak` — TagBak (one-way backup)
- `ts-restore` — TagRestore
- `tsync` or `ts-sync` — TagSync (sync engine)
- `ts-search` — TagSearch
- `ts-report` — TagReport

## Project Status

- **TagBak** (v0.1.1): Implements core tagging and selective backup.
- Other modules: *Planned/in development.*
